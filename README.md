## GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Communicating Using Markdown

Welcome to **my** repository for the GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository was used during the different activities that some bot actully did guide me through.

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm Raymond, but most people call me Ray. 

Anyway, the GitHub Learning Lab bot helped guide me throughout my journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I used and learnt Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with the bot.
